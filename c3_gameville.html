We aimed to push the envelope of the existing game by exploring several ideas over a single quarter (Q2). These concepts had to be more than simple content updates. The intention was to introduce dynamic systems that could provide exponential value to the game, instead of scripts/items/characters.</p> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <br><br> <p>The scope of work was defined by a department-wide survey on what would be nice to explore. </p> <ul> <li>Quest Log interface</li> <li>New battle mechanics (complexity)</li> <li>Dynamic Camera system</li> <li>Interactables (Difficulty Indicators, Quests alerts, etc)</li> </ul> <p>We set out to build a small world in <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a> called Gameville that would be a playable prototype that explored these concepts. </p> </div> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_1.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:0"> </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="sub-header">Team Structure</p> <p>The format of this team could be called an ‘internal startup’ or an incubator. There were no specific production goals, but instead the focus was an internal ‘vertical slice’ of potential features. This work was meant to inform future efforts only! But that really let us get creative. </p> <p>I was the only Product Designer on the team again, but there was a strong collaboration between myself, three Game Designers, one PM, and two Artists. We all contributed to testable prototypes. My own focus was to incorporate usability findings using both <b>Unity</b> and <b>ProtoPie</b>. When using a game engine wasn’t feasible due to time constraints, I would use faster tools to answer specific product questions like <b>InVision</b>.</p> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="sub-header">Design Process</p> <p>Since the scope of work was built entirely on broadening an existing game, there were less exploratory wireframe than I was used to. Instead, we jumped to realistic prototyping quite quickly -- but I was excited to use the tools mentioned above!</p> <p>Another strong influence on the design process here was the access we had to classroom testing. We had almost unlimited access to kids due to the summer season, and we wanted to take advantage! We had many rounds of testing in classrooms, and also hosted ‘game rooms’ inside the company headquarters where we could sit side by side and play with students.</p> <p>I structured these sessions, and made sure everyone had a research script to follow.</p> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <video width="480" height="300" controls> <source src="video/video/usertesting1.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> </div> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <p>After each session, I would summarize usability findings and worked with the Game Designers to make rapid iterative improvements before we went in again! </p> <p>Here are some highlights of what we were testing in each round:</p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vAdj_0VHgFOyoffc_ywq8FGIGqT_5hnM2p5VHe4Jc1w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View PDF</div> </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="title-small">Battle Mechanics</p> <p>We wanted to add some complexty to the battle system by introducing a new depth of statistics, but had to make sure these were understood by our young players. </p> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_3.png" alt="map"> </div> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <p>Game Designers brainstormed a system of <b>stamina</b>(green), <b>mana</b> (blue), <b>defense</b> (yellow) and <b>power</b> (pink) seen here.</p> <p>Initially, there was little visual difference between the stats (below Pets) and the cost (above Spells). We found that this layout, along with a high amount of abstract icons and digits, caused more confusion than fun.</p> </div> </div> <p>This was an early challenge for me when balancing usability and game design needs, and I realized I had to ‘think as a game designer’ to find the right balance here. </p> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <p>One approach I tested was to use flippable <i>Spell Cards</i> that put these stats lower in the information hierarchy, but still were available to more advanced players who could understand these nuances. </p> <p>As you can see in this prototype, there is a lot going on in terms of <i>micro-interactions</i>.</p> <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/NDvfw7YJBm7?ui=false&mockup=false&touchHint=false&scaleToFit=false&cursorType=touch" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype</div> </a> </div> <div class="column col-6 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_7.png" alt="map"> </div> </div> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-4 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_8.png" alt="map"> </div> <div class="column col-8 col-xs-12"> <p>Another example of soliving this problem was trying out a ‘Cooldown’ mechanic. This allowed stamina and other stats to be removed, but still offered a gameplay system that matched the need for strategy.</p> <p>I tested out several ideas that respected this deeper game experience, aiming to make things feel intuitive. </p> <p>Other areas expored here included:</p> <ul> <li>Mana costs for spells</li> <li>Indication for lack of casting cost (gray/red)</li> <li>Damage stats</li> <li>Target type selection (area or single)</li> </ul> <br> <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/9mMqThQgdUA?ui=false&mockup=false&touchHint=false&scaleToFit=false&cursorType=touch" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype</div> </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="title-small">Quest Log</p> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-8 col-xs-12"> <p>We got to test out a fairly realistic Quest Log system as well. I brainstormed with Game Designers about what this could entail, and created a <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/3ZTE5467NDE#/screens/378783222" target="_blank">set of wireframes </a>as a first step. This helped get a proper idea of what we were looking to validate. </p> <p>Once that was completed, I was able to build Quest Log v1 that reflected a specific set of questions. UX Researchers helped us at this point to create a testing script we could use with students. </p> <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/fueLFFUjemK" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype 1</div> </a> </div> <div class="column col-4 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_5.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:0"> </div> </div> <br><br><br> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-4 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_6.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:0"> </div> <div class="column col-8 col-xs-12"> <p>After the first round of testing, we added several updates to improve understanding of Quests such as: </p> <ul> <li>Stronger indication of 'current quest', using motion and color</li> <li>A more dynamic mini-map in the upper right that reacts to quest selection</li> <li>An improved 'map key' to help players find content</li> </ul> <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/QBvVkN6d9ZG" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype 2</div> </a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="title-small">New Camera Systems</p> <p>We performed experiments with three camera types (seen below). Using our <b>Unity</b> prototype, we ran players through an identical scenario of completing a Quest, using each camera type. </p> <p>Results from these tests were summarized using a Rainbow Analysis, segmented by age group.</p> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c3_4.png" alt="map"> <p>Here is an example of the prototype in action!</p> <video width="640" height="400" controls> <source src="video/video/usertesting2.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="title-small">Interactables</p> <p>Part of this scope of work was pushing the limits of in-world interactions. This included things like: </p> <ul> <li>Difficulty Indicators</li> <li>In-World Objects</li> <li>Quest NPCs</li> </ul> <p>I've included an example of research and ideation on Difficulty Indicators:</p> <a href="links/EnemyCon.pdf" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View PDF</div> </a> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="sub-header">Outcomes and Results</p> <p>Results from this project were handed off as <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dwd8xxBUhYOjbfPHmXzzhSj6KllqSjI8A6FUAjQidMQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Rainbow Analysis spreadsheets</a>, based on the questions we were answering. </p> <p>The high-fidelity prototypes also acted as a solid base that Engineers could work off of for their production goals. There was a lot more clarity with these prototypes vs. documents and wireframes, since they were quite playable in many ways! We heard about how much timed this saved by removing overhead in this way. </p> <p>When the project’s handoffs were completed, the team moved on to other projects. We got to see the impact of our efforts in new features. </p> <p>For example, the moving camera system was used in <a href="c1_crystal_caverns.html">Crystal Caverns</a>. The battle mechanics and play exploration are feeding into two in-development game features for release in 2021!</p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dwd8xxBUhYOjbfPHmXzzhSj6KllqSjI8A6FUAjQidMQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Analysis</div> </a> </div> <div class="text-block text-center"> <a href="c4_design_hacking.html"> <div class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Read Next Case Study</div> </a> </div> </div> <footer class="footer" id="footer" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-6 col-sm-12"> <p class="title-small">Contact</p> <p><a href="mailto:mail@adriandalimonte.com">mail@adriandalimonte.com</a> <br> 647 831 8468</p> </div> </div> </div> <p class="tagline">Hand-coded with <a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html" target="_blank"><b>Spectre</b></a> and <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank"><b>InterUI</b></a> </p>
