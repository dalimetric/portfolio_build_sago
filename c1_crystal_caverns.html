Ideation</p> <p>We ideated on these goals and came up with a few testable concepts that focused on ‘gameplay mechanics’ and ‘feature discovery’. There was a blurred line between Game and Product Design happening here that I really liked, because they overlap so much when weaving together an awesome experience for players!</p> <p>Our ideas for the scope of this project were as follows:</p> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c1_1.png" alt="Ideation"> <p class="title-small">2. Wireframes</p> <p>Before jumping to high-fidelity too quickly, I completed a wireframe flow of the proposed end-to-end experience. This was created in Sketch and was used as content for the GDD. It also served as a touchpoint for discussions, to ensure we were all on the same page for what we were building here. </p> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c1_2.png" alt="Wireframes"> <p class="title-small">3. Prototype Time</p> <p>Once we were aligned and ready to move forward, a plan was made for some ‘high fidelity’ prototyping. </p> <p>For game mechanics, we used the <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker" target="_blank">GameMaker2</a> game engine to make completely realistic (yet flexible) prototypes that could be adjusted easily based on our research findings. Three rounds of testing happened on this front, visiting classrooms in the area. </p> <p>I wasn’t using Unity for this particular project, but knowledge of C# helped me jump into this game engine with no pauses. I collaborated fully with GDs on creating these experiences.</p> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-4 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c1_4.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:14px"> <a href="links/links/html-wyrm/index.html" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype</div> </a> </div> <div class="column col-4 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c1_5.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:14px"> <a href="links/links/html-yeti/index.html" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype</div> </a> </div> <div class="column col-4 col-xs-12"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c1_3.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:14px"> <a href="links/links/html-golem/index.html" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View Prototype</div> </a> </div> </div> <br> <br> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-8"> <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/a308f351bd" target="_blank"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/c1_6.png" alt="map" style="padding-bottom:14px"> </a> </div> <div class="column col-4"> <p>To accompany these playtests, I also used ProtoPie to simulate some complexity around interfaces.

Classroom Visits</p> <p>Our testing for this feature was intended to be strictly qualitative until release. Luckily there were a lot of company contacts with teachers, and they were happy to have our team hang out with their students! </p> <a href="links/Crystal Caverns Research Session .pdf" target="_blank"> <div class="btn btn-primary">View PDF</div> </a> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="sub-header">Outcomes and Results</p> <p>After three rounds of classroom testing, we were able to tweak the game mechanics to find that right balance of usability and playbility. A few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Adding more emphasis on 'healing item' options for tougher battles</li> <li>Updating the <a href="links/links/RestartFlow.pdf" target="_blank"> Restart/Exit flow</a> for missions</li> <li>Making players of all ages <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/58ab46b038?ui=false&mockup=false&touchHint=false&scaleToFit=false&cursorType=touch" target="_blank">aware of 'element switching'</a> in battles</li> </ul>
<br> <p> In terms of numbers...</p> <ul> <li><b>Overall, 90% of users that finish the feature the first time tried again at least once.</b> (50% was the goal)</li> <li><b>The cumulative number of battles in Crystal Caverns is 114% higher than that of the next zone.</b>(25% was the goal)</li> <li><b>The completion rate of the 6th quest of Crystal Caverns is 6.34%, which is higher than the completion rate of the 6th quest of all other major zones.</b> (longevity goal achieved)</li> </ul> </div> <div class="text-block"> <p class="sub-header">Reflection</p> <p>Crystal Caverns was a great experience for me to learn about game prototyping, and the balance between UX and gameplay challenge!</p> <p>My main highlight for our <i>project postmortem</i> was to put a focus on low-fidelity and validating hypothesis before digging too deep on realistic game experiences. Prototyping is powerful but it can be a large time investment if you aren't placed on the right path at an early stage.</p> <p>Just a personal note of caution fortunately, that I've taken forward to all my future efforts!</p> </div> <div class="text-block text-center"> <a href="c2_crafty_house.html"> <div class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Read Next Case Study</div> </a> </div> </div> <footer class="footer" id="footer" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> <div class="columns"> <div class="column col-6 col-sm-12"> <p class="title-small">Contact</p> <p><a href="mailto:mail@adriandalimonte.com">mail@adriandalimonte.com</a> <br> 647 831 8468</p> </div> </div> </div> <p class="tagline">Hand-coded with <a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html" target="_blank"><b>Spectre</b></a> and <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank"><b>InterUI</b></a> </p>
